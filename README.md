#Spatial databases assignments

**NOTE: The assignments, files or any instructions included are on *Croatian*!**

Here are a few  assignments I had in college from the course *Spatial databases*.

**If you have any questions please feel free to ask!**

##Files

In the folder *podaci_ispit* are spatial files necessary for solving the assignments in the folder *zad*.

The assignments are only solvable with [**shapely**](http://toblerity.org/shapely/manual.html) and [**matplotlib**](http://matplotlib.org/).
